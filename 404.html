    // then set pathSegmentsToKeep to 1 (enterprise users may need to set it to > 1).
    // This way the code will only replace the route part of the path, and not
    // the real directory in which the app resides, for example:
    // https://username.github.io/repo-name/one/two?a=b&c=d#qwe becomes

    <p >When it comes to our service we don't compromise on security. If you've noticed something that doesn't seem quite right with any of our platforms please let us know details of the vulnerability and how to reproduce it.</p>
    <p >Although we welcome all reports of suspected vulnerabilities, we aren't able to respond to every email, and aren't offering rewards or bounties for any finding forwarded to us.</p>
    <p >We expect professionalism from any security researchers and for them to avoid privacy or legal violations; these violations include (amongst others) not destroying or corrupting our data, not interrupting our operations, not targeting our staff, not performing any scans on our systems and not trying to access the account details of any other user.</p>
    <p >If you have disclosed a valid unique bug we will of course pass this on to our teams internally to resolve, but will not be able to keep you updated on the progress of the report. Regardless of the outcome of your finding we would ask that disclosures are made directly to us, and that no public disclosure is made without our prior explicit consent.</p>

The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the services, whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject, or whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position.</p>
    <p >Deletion: Upon your request, we will delete or anonymize your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:</p>
    <p >If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute, we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved.</p>
    <p >Where we are required to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law.</p>
