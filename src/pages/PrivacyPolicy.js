            <p className="mini-text">Our responsibility:</p>
            <p className="mini-text">• Malaaz is the ‘controller’ of your personal data. This means we decide how and why your data is processed any time you use our service. We go into this in more detail below.</p>
            <p className="mini-text">Your responsibility:</p>
            <p className="mini-text">• Please read this policy and make sure you’re happy with it before using our service.</p>

            <h2 className="sub-text">Your property information</h2>
            <p className="mini-text">This policy applies to the personal information you share with us, not the information about properties we show on our website or apps. This information is about the property itself, not about the occupants or owners of that property.</p>
            <p className="mini-text">If you have any questions about the property information we display, contact-us. If you’re selling or letting a property that’s being advertised on our service, please direct any questions to your estate agent or individual advertising it.</p>

            <h2 className="sub-text">Data Collection</h2>
            <p className="mini-text">When you use our service, we collect data about your visit. In this section, we outline what information we collect about you when you use our services, and why we collect it.</p>

            <p className="mini-text">This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

            <h2 className="sub-text">Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</h2>
            <p className="mini-text">When it comes to our service we don't compromise on security. If you've noticed something that doesn't seem quite right with any of our platforms please let us know details of the vulnerability and how to reproduce it.</p>
            <p className="mini-text">Although we welcome all reports of suspected vulnerabilities, we aren't able to respond to every email, and aren't offering rewards or bounties for any finding forwarded to us.</p>
            <p className="mini-text">We expect professionalism from any security researchers and for them to avoid privacy or legal violations; these violations include (amongst others) not destroying or corrupting our data, not interrupting our operations, not targeting our staff, not performing any scans on our systems and not trying to access the account details of any other user.</p>
            <p className="mini-text">If you have disclosed a valid unique bug we will of course pass this on to our teams internally to resolve, but will not be able to keep you updated on the progress of the report. Regardless of the outcome of your finding we would ask that disclosures are made directly to us, and that no public disclosure is made without our prior explicit consent.</p>
